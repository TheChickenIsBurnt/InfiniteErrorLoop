# InfiniteErrorLoop
This lags your computer by bombarding your PC with infinite error loops. 

# ATTENTION

THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT HARM YOUR COMPUTER IN ANY WAY. IT DOES NOT DELETE OR ADD FILES, IT ONLY CREATES AN ERROR LOOP. Just restart your PC, it will be fine.

# How to execute

To begin the program, just double click on the Batch file (named error.bat). DO NOT RUN THE VBS FILE, IT WILL NOT WORK. YOU WILL ALSO NEED A WINDOWS PC TO RUN VBS FILES. MAC, LINUX OR ANY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS WILL NOT WORK!!!
